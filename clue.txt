Project 1 clarification
Posted on: Monday, February 18, 2019 3:55:39 PM CST

Dear all,

Consider this project as having two phases:
Phase one: Entering critical section
Phase two: Performing read/write operations on servers

Phase one: it does not concern any server, it is just between clients.
Each client upon requesting a file operations, regardless of the write or the read operation, sends its request
to other four clients, and waits for their replies. Each client upon receiving a request, sends its reply to the
requesting client if:
i) it has no request to send, or
ii) its own request has higher timestamp than the received request.
The requester client can enter its critical section when it receives all four replies.
Upon entering its critical section, it will not send any reply to any other clients, and will keep them in a queue,
and when it exits its critical section, it sends all delayed replies to their requesters.

Phase two: it is the critical section part of each client. Each client upon entering its critical section,
send its operation to all three servers. Each server upon receiving an operation request from a client, performs the
requested operation and sends an appropriate message to the requester client, should it finishes the operation.
The client upon receiving all three messages from three clients, will exit its critical section and if it has
delayed any reply to the requests of other clients, it will send them.
For the first phase, there is an optimization which is mentioned in the slides,
which explains some cases in which there is no need to send the request to all four other clients.
You are required to implement the optimization as well.
If you have any other questions or doubts, let me know or come to my office hours so we can discuss about them.

Best,

Aliehsan
